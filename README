# Frontend app starter

Here is a starter for a frontend app including webpack to create bundle


## Add frontend frameworks/tools

    npm install bootstrap mithril --save


## Add webpack loaders / plugins

You may want to edit webpack.config.js to define routes / files to bundle

    npm install loader-LOADER --save-dev


## Install

    npm install


## Webpack watch / livereload

    npm start


or you can use a global webpack install for more options


    npm install -g webpack


so simply use


    webpack
